"""
CI checks that are too long to live inside the workflow YAML.

They started out as heredocs in `.github/workflows/tests.yml` and moved here
for one practical reason: a Python block nested inside YAML inside a shell
`run:` needs three levels of quoting to stay intact, and shell-quoted regexes
like '(ws|wss)://[^ "'"'"']+' do not survive being copied through a browser.
A separate .py file is copy-paste safe, runs locally, and can be read on its
own.

Run any of these from the repo root:

    python .github/ci_checks.py --help-check
    python .github/ci_checks.py --sample-check
    python .github/ci_checks.py --secret-check
    python .github/ci_checks.py --all

Each prints what it looked at and exits non-zero on failure.

    ASK GIT rather than matching strings. `.gitignore` has patterns,
    negations and directory scoping, so a substring test proves nothing
    about what would actually be committed -- and this check's whole claim
    is about what IS committed.

    Two ways this must not break, because this project ships as a zip as
    often as it is cloned:
      * outside a git repository, and
      * with `git` absent from PATH
    it returns an empty set, so nothing is filtered and the scan behaves
    exactly as it did before. A guard that takes the check down is worse
    than the gap it closes.

    One subprocess for the whole list, not one per file: `--stdin` exists
    for this, and `-z` keeps filenames with spaces or newlines intact --
    this repo lives under a path with a space in it.
