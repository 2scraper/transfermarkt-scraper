diff_runs.py
-------------
Compares two output files from this project (JSON, as written by
output_writer.save) and reports what changed between them, keyed on `sku`.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old market_values.2026-09-01.json \\
                          --new market_values.2026-09-08.json

Typical use is a scheduled re-run of --mode market-values or --mode
club-squad, kept under a dated filename, diffed against the previous one to
track market-value moves and (via `club_id`) transfers.

Four buckets, each keyed on sku:

  added     — sku present in --new, absent from --old
  removed   — sku present in --old, absent from --new (dropped out of the
              ranking / squad, or just off this particular page/run)
  changed   — sku present in both, with a different price, currency, club
              or club_id
  unmatched — a row this project's parser could not recover a sku for
              (None), counted rather than folded into added/removed

Unlike this family's e-commerce members, there is no `price_source`
disagreement to route around here: every Player row's `price` is a DOM
reading (see output_writer.py's docstring — there is no JSON-LD to
cross-check it against), so a price difference between two runs is either a
real market-value change or noise from the site re-rendering, and this repo
has no second, more-trustworthy reading to tell those apart. There is also
no `--price-tolerance-pct` here: this family's exchange-rate rationale for
that flag does not apply (every value is EUR — see product_parser.py), and
Transfermarkt updates market values in whole steps (rounds of thousands or
millions, not continuously), so there is no small-currency-tick noise to
absorb in the first place.

Only Player-mode runs (market-values, club-squad, player) carry `club`/
`club_id` at all — a Transfer row's dict has no such key, so `before.get()`
/ `after.get()` both read None for it on a transfers-mode diff and it never
registers a spurious change. The same holds in reverse for the
Transfer-only fields below (`from_club`, `to_club`, `fee_type`, ...) on a
Player-mode diff: both sides read None via `.get()`, so adding fields that
belong to the OTHER schema never manufactures a spurious "changed" entry —
it only adds coverage for whichever mode's rows actually carry that field.
