# waf_probe.sh — measure how often transfermarkt.com answers with an AWS WAF
# captcha instead of the page, FROM WHEREVER YOU RUN IT.
#
# Why this ships in the repo rather than living in a notebook: the README and
# .env.example both quote a figure (8 of 10 requests challenged from a bare
# datacentre address, 2026-09-16), and a number describing a living thing has
# to arrive with the command that reproduces it or not be written down at
# all. That figure is a property of an address on a day, not of the site —
# from a proxied exit the same day, the real page came back every time.
#
#   ./tools/waf_probe.sh                 # 10 requests to market-values
#   ./tools/waf_probe.sh 20              # 20 requests
#   ./tools/waf_probe.sh 10 transfers    # a different mode
#   ./tools/waf_probe.sh 10 market-values --direct   # ignore any proxy
#
# Modes: market-values | club-squad | transfers | player
#
# THE EXIT IT MEASURES
# --------------------
# By default this goes through TRANSFERMARKT_PROXY when .env sets one,
# because "is this address challenged" is a question about an EXIT, and
# measuring the machine you happen to be sitting at answers it for one exit
# only. With no proxy configured, or with --direct, it measures this machine.
#
# The proxy is resolved by env_config.py, the same loader every engine uses,
# so precedence is the documented one (a real environment variable beats
# .env) and only one place decides it. It reaches curl through
# `https_proxy`/`http_proxy` in the ENVIRONMENT -- never a command-line flag,
# because `ps` reads argv. Only the masked host and port are ever printed.
#
# Reading the output: a page the site actually served answers from
# `server: nginx`, its own origin. A refusal answers from `server: CloudFront`
# with `x-amzn-waf-action: captcha` — CloudFront generated it at the edge and
# the request never reached Transfermarkt at all.
