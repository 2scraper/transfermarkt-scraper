# verify_browser_api.sh — does the Scraping Browser API actually clear this
# site's AWS WAF challenge, or does it merely never meet one?
#
# Those two outcomes look identical from a single successful run, and telling
# them apart is the whole point of this script. A measurement with no negative
# case is an anecdote: if the exit you are testing from is not challenged in
# the first place, a green run through the Browser API proves nothing about
# auto-solve.
#
# So it runs three legs and compares them:
#
#   1. CONTROL   — a plain HTTP probe from THIS machine, to establish whether
#                  this network position gets challenged at all.
#   2. BASELINE  — a local Chromium run, no Browser API.
#   3. TEST      — the same run through --cdp-endpoint.
#
# Read the verdict at the end; it says which of the four possible worlds you
# are in, including the two where the answer is "inconclusive, and here is
# why".
#
# Needs: .env with TWOCAPTCHA_KEY and TRANSFERMARKT_CDP_ENDPOINT, and
# playwright installed. Prints no secrets.
