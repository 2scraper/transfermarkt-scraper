transfermarkt-scraper — 2captcha Scraper API edition (fourth engine)
======================================================================

A fourth way to run this scraper. Unlike playwright_scraper.py /
puppeteer_scraper.py / selenium_scraper.py, this one manages **no browser and
no CDP session of its own**: it POSTs a URL to 2captcha's separate **Scraper
API** (https://scraper.2captcha.com — a different product from the Scraping
Browser API the other three reach through --cdp-endpoint), gets HTML back over
plain HTTPS, and feeds it to this project's product_parser.

Ported from this family's mediamarkt-scraper (site knowledge here is ~none —
see CLAUDE.md's own module table), not written on spec: v0.1 shipped without
it on the reasoning that porting a fourth engine on spec, with no measured
page needing it, would be dead code. That reasoning does not hold for this
site specifically — see below — which is why this file exists now.

WHAT THIS SITE NEEDS — READ THIS FIRST
---------------------------------------
**This section said the opposite until v0.4.1, and the correction is the
point of it.** It used to state that nothing here needs JavaScript and that
no proxy or `--cdp-url` was needed — measured on 2026-09-10 and true of that
measurement, but not true as a general statement about the site.

Transfermarkt sits behind AWS WAF on CloudFront. Measured 2026-09-16, ten
consecutive requests to the market-values ranking from one datacentre
address, one UA, two seconds apart: **eight were answered with an AWS WAF
CAPTCHA** — HTTP 405, `x-amzn-waf-action: captcha`, `server: CloudFront`,
a 2331-byte "Human Verification" body — and two with the real page, which
answers from `server: nginx`, the site's own origin. A served page and a
refused one are told apart by which server answered.

So the honest summary is narrower than the old one:

* The HTML itself still needs no JavaScript — when the site serves the page,
  a plain fetch parses it completely. That part held up.
* Whether a plain fetch GETS the page depends on where it comes from.
  A 2Captcha proxy exit was measured returning the real page with zero
  captcha solves and zero renders on 2026-09-16; a bare datacentre address
  was challenged on 8 of 10 attempts the same day. Neither number is a
  property of the site alone, and neither should be quoted without its
  network position and its date.
* When the challenge does appear, it is solvable rather than fatal: 2Captcha
  solves AWS WAF captchas through task type `AmazonTaskProxyless`
  (`captcha_solver.detect_aws_waf` builds it from the `window.gokuProps`
  the challenge page itself publishes). What this repo has NOT yet done is
  run that path against a live challenge with a real key — so it is
  implemented and unit-tested, not live-verified, and this file will say so
  until someone runs it.

So `--cdp-url` exists here for parity with the family template and for the
day this stops being true (see product_parser.BOT_CHALLENGE_MARKERS for
what would trigger it), but it is NOT required the way mediamarkt-scraper's
equivalent flag is — do not assume this repo needs one just because a
sibling repo's identical-looking flag does.

**Pagination is stateless-HTTP-only, checked per run.** `--mode transfers`'s
`?page=N` is independently addressable on every capture taken of it so far
(page 2 shares 0 transfer ids with page 1, measured 2026-09-10). `--mode
market-values` usually is too — see page_flow.py's "gallery pagination
trap": a wider re-measurement found the plain `?page=N` shape on 28 of 29
consecutive fetches, with only a rare, intermittent capture needing a
stateful browser session instead (a doubled path segment whose stateless
page-2 fetch returns page 1's content again). This client checks page 1's
own next-link against what `?page=N` would build, the SAME
`page_flow.pagination_is_addressable` check the browser engines make off
the live DOM, and only refuses `--pages N > 1` for market-values on the
runs where that check actually fails — it does not refuse unconditionally.
When it does refuse, this is exit 6 (partial): use playwright_scraper.py,
which chains the site's own link one page at a time within a browser
session for exactly that case. `--mode club-squad` and `--mode player` are
naturally single-page already.

API surface used (per https://2captcha.com/scraper/scraper-api/api)
------------------------------------------------------------------
  POST https://scraper.2captcha.com/tasks/sync
    Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
    Content-Type: application/json
    {"task_type": "scrape", "url": ..., "data_format": "raw",
     "format": "json", "timeout": 1..120,
     "waitFor": "<JSON *string*, not an object>",
     "cdpurl": "ws://user:pass@host:port"   # optional
    }
  -> 200 {"status": 200, "headers": {...}, "body": "<!DOCTYPE html>..."}

Note `waitFor` must be a JSON *string* (double-encoded), and the param is
spelled `cdpurl` (all lowercase) while `waitFor` is camelCase — that is the
API's own inconsistency, not a typo here.

Usage
-----
    # plain HTTP, no browser anywhere -- this is the normal case for this site
    python3 scraper_api_client.py --key "$TWOCAPTCHA_KEY" --mode market-values

        --mode club-squad --club-id 281 --season 2025

    python3 scraper_api_client.py --key "$TWOCAPTCHA_KEY" \\
        --mode transfers --pages 3

    python3 scraper_api_client.py --key "$TWOCAPTCHA_KEY" \\
        --mode player --player-id 418560

    # only if a live run ever finds this site DOES need one -- see above
    python3 scraper_api_client.py --key "$TWOCAPTCHA_KEY" --mode market-values \\
        --cdp-url "ws://user:pass@cb.2captcha.com:9222" --wait-text "table"

Requires: pip install -r requirements.txt
          (no playwright/selenium/pyppeteer needed for this engine)
