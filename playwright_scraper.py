transfermarkt-scraper — Playwright edition (primary engine)
=============================================================

Scrapes Transfermarkt's market-value ranking, a club's squad, the
latest-transfers feed, and individual player profiles, from
five verified Transfermarkt hosts (English `.com`, German `.de`, Russian
`.world`, Korean `.co.kr`, Japanese `.jp` — see product_parser.LOCALE_BY_HOST
and README "Locales"; every other Transfermarkt TLD is refused rather than
guessed at).

    --mode market-values   the global "most valuable players" ranking.
                           Paginated, but NOT independently addressable —
                           see page_flow.py's "gallery pagination trap".
                           --concurrency is not available for this mode.
    --mode club-squad      one club's current roster. Give --club-id (and
                           optionally --season); single page, no --pages.
    --mode transfers       the latest-transfers feed. Paginated with a
                           plain, independently-addressable ?page=N — the
                           one mode here --concurrency actually helps.
    --mode player          one player's profile page. Give --player-id.
                           Single page.

Three engines ship in this repo and they must agree on exit codes, run
status, and whether a run crashes or spends money; the shared decisions live
in output_writer.finish_run() and page_flow.py so they cannot drift apart.

What is different about Transfermarkt
--------------------------------------
* **Nothing here needs JavaScript to render.** Every page captured for this
  repo (a ranking page, a squad page, a transfer list, a player profile)
  arrived as complete HTML from a plain proxied fetch — no scrolling, no
  hydration wait. What a browser buys here is a normal-looking TCP/TLS
  fingerprint and cookie jar, not rendering.
* **No JSON-LD anywhere.** See product_parser.py's docstring. Extraction is
  DOM-anchored throughout.
* **market-values pagination is not a plain URL.** Read
  page_flow.py's "gallery pagination trap" before changing anything about
  --mode market-values --pages. Short version: a stateless fetch of a
  reconstructed page-2 URL was measured to return page 1 again, so this
  engine follows the site's own pagination link ONE PAGE AT A TIME, within
  a single browser session, and stops (reporting `partial`, not a silent
  duplicate) the moment a page adds nothing new — the same "terminating
  condition based on data" layer this family always keeps as the backstop.
* **No captcha or 403 wall was observed in this repo's research** (one
  proxied fetch each of the four page kinds above, 2026-09-10) — see
  captcha_solver.py's closing note for exactly what that does and does not
  license. The detect+solve machinery is still wired in, broad by design.

Usage
-----
    python playwright_scraper.py --mode market-values --pages 3

    python playwright_scraper.py --mode club-squad --club-id 281 --season 2025

    python playwright_scraper.py --mode transfers --pages 5 --concurrency 3 \\
        --proxy-file proxylist.txt

    python playwright_scraper.py --mode player --player-id 418560

Requires: pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-playwright.txt
          then: playwright install chromium   (only if NOT using --cdp-endpoint)
